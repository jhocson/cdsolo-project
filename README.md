PROJECT NAME:
Connectable 

DESCRIPTION
I want to make a program that allows users to browse through & join different events/activities with other users also using the program. This lays the premise that the other participants joining the user at the event/activity also want to socialize & connect with new people. The concept is similar to the iSport example project.

The goal of this program is to create opportunuities to participate in activities/events that the user would not want to go to by themselves, while also allowing them to broaden their social circle with people that share similar interests as them. I want to do this as my project because I struggle with social anxiety & I've noticed as I've gotten older it became harder to meet people. And while there are many different events/activities in my area that I would like to participate in, at times I can be too scared or nervous to do them by myself. 


STACK
Python (?) I would really like to do Python, but I think I might have done something to my Environment Variables setup that is causing my commands not to be recognized in the terminal... Like it doesn't recognize python or pip... I must have messed something up.. Please please advise.
